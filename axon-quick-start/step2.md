# Explore Axon Server Dashboard

With Axon Server running in the background you can now [visit the Axon Server Dashboard](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8024-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/).

The main view shows information about the configuration and the status of the server. In addition to that there are few more views:

 - [Overview](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8024-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/#overview) displays topology diagram and information about connected client applications. At this moment there are none so you'll only see the server there. 

 - [Search](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8024-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/#query) allows you to query the server for past events using [Axon Server Query Language](https://docs.axoniq.io/reference-guide/appendices/query-reference). As we just started a fresh server there are no events to be found yet.

 - [Commands](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8024-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/#commands) provide information about what commands were handled and by who. At this point no commands have been issued so the list will be empty.

 - [Queries](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8024-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/#queries) provide information about what queries were handled and by who. At this point no queries have been issued so the list will be empty.

Take a minute to familiarize yourself with the dashboard and them move to the next step.
