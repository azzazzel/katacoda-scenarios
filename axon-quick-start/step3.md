# Get the gift card demo app

> The [giftcard-demo](https://github.com/AxonIQ/giftcard-demo) demo application focuses around a simple domain - gift cards. Essentially, there are just two events in the life cycle of a gift card:
>
> - They get issued: a new gift card gets created with some amount of money stored.
> - They get redeemed: all or part of the monetary value stored on the gift card is used to purchase something.
>
> The application comes with a simple web UI to issue and redeem gift cards.
